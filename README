This is going to become a rewrite of the KDE 1
Game "KBattelShip". After porting the original
code to KDE2, we were not satisfied so we will
do a complete rewrite. Any help is highly
appriciated. Don't hesitate to contact us.

The original port can be found in "old/".
It compiles but works not completely and
is inefficent in concerns of drawing and network
communication, thus coming without any
guaraty to work (tm).
