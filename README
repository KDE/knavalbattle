KBattleship 1.0
-----------------------------------

KBatteship is a KDE implentation of the
popular game "Battleship".

In the current version, you can play it
with two computers in a TCP/IP based
network and (as of version 0.7) with the
computer.

KBattleship uses an XML based protocol,
meaning you can write a compatible application
in almost every programming or scripting
language (Would be nice to hear of a
GNOME port)

If you have ideas or want to get involved,
simple contanct the authors (see AUTHORS).

Have a lot of fun!
