as discussed with danimo:
- after a game the loosing opponent should see the others ships.
- there should be at least 2 sets of ships. Like 2 different navys
- one should be able to choose between different sets of maps:
  - maps with or without land/island or whatever
  - maps of differnt size (bigger maps with more ships)
